### Changed

- **MLX JIT build no longer patches vendored MLX.** The
  `patches/mlx-jit-nax-gate.patch` workaround (and the
  `maybe_apply_mlx_patches` plumbing in `mix.exs`) has been removed.
  The JIT build now requires the macOS 26.2+ SDK directly, which
  ships `<MetalPerformancePrimitives/MetalPerformancePrimitives.h>`;
  the AOT (default) build is unchanged and still works on older
  macOS. Upstream discussion:
  [ml-explore/mlx#3426](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx/pull/3426).
- **CI matrix split across macOS versions.** The `jit=0` row stays
  on `macos-14` to keep AOT coverage on older macOS; the `jit=1`
  row now runs on `macos-26` so the Metal Performance Primitives
  SDK is available natively.
